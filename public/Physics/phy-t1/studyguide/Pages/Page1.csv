term-phy-t1-1,key_term,Inertia,Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion.,,,,4
misc-phy-t1-1,misconception,Motion Requires Force,Many students believe that a constant force is required to keep an object moving at a constant speed.,Newton's 1st Law states that an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.,Force is needed to change motion (acceleration), not to maintain constant velocity (in the absence of friction).,,5
