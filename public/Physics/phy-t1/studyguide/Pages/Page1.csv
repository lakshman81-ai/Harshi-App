misc-phy-t1-1,misconception,Motion Requires Force,"Students believe a constant force is needed to keep an object moving at constant speed.",Newton's 1st Law: An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net force.,,Friction is usually the force that stops objects; in a vacuum, no force is needed to maintain constant velocity.,5,
